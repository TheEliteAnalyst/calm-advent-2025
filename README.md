# calm-advent-2025

A 24-day hands-on challenge to dive deep into CALM concepts, model real-world identity architectures, and contribute meaningfully to the FINOS community — built as part of my security and open source development journey.

# My Advent of CALM Journey

This repository tracks my 24-day journey learning the Common Architecture Language Model (CALM).

## 📅 Challenge Summary

Each day, I complete a small architectural modeling task, document it, and commit it as a milestone.

- ✅ Uses [CALM CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@finos/calm-cli)
- ✅ Structure powered by Git + GitHub Copilot (optional)
- ✅ One folder per day with its own README
